## Problem being solved
People want to know if they're loved ones are ok.

## Possible data 
Users contacts numbers

## Execution 
Spin up a server that creates a group of people with their phone numbers. Once a group is created the app will check in daily with each group's members to see if they are ok. If a person in a group hasn't checked in in more than 36 hours, it will send an alert to the whole group.

## Idea source
People are now checking on each other as they see the news and are freaked out.
